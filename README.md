Hacktoberfest 2021 Recap

Every October, DigitalOcean demonstrates our love for the open source community with Hacktoberfest, a month-long event where developers of all skill levels donate their time to support open source projects. Developers everywhere rely on projects that the open source community pours their energy into maintaining. Our goal with Hacktoberfest is to give back to those pillars of the developer community and help keep their important open source projects up and running.

Hacktoberfest launched in 2013 with 700 participants. Hacktoberfest 2021 had more than 141,000 participants contributing to the open source projects they love. We are incredibly proud of how much Hacktoberfest has grown over the years, and in 2021 we were especially pleased with how the global open source community came together to create quality submissions and show their thanks to maintainers.

Hacktoberfest couldn’t happen without the participation and contributions of the community, but it wouldn’t be possible at all without the generous support of our partners. A special thanks to Appwrite, Intel, and DeepSource for their in-depth partnership, and a big thanks to our community partners such as GitHub, GitLab, and many more who love open source just as much as we do.
